<h1>Python</h1>
<p>
  Python is a interpreted, object-oriented, high level programming language used in various domains such as web developemnt, game development, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data visualisation and other programming applications.
  <h3>Python Internal Working</h3>
  <p>Python code is first compiled to bytecode, which is then interpreted by the CPython interpreter to convert the bytecode to machine-level code. Bytecode is a virtualized form of machine code intended for an idealized or virtual processor rather than a real one. This bytecode is stored in .pyc files which are stored in __pycache__.

The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) takes these bytecode instructions and converts them into machine code so that the computer can execute them and display the final output. To perform this conversion, the PVM uses an interpreter. Hence, Python is known as an interpreted language.

In Python, everything, including data types, variables, and functions, is treated as an object
